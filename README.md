# Mini-Weather-Reporter
We aim to provide outwear suggestions to UBC students, especially first year students. 
The rationale behind is that we understand it is difficult to decide how many layers of clothing to wear in the morning 
when you have little experience of how cold or hot the weather is when being indoor for quite a while. 
With reminders through RGB light bulb, users can take in a more accurate suggestion.
